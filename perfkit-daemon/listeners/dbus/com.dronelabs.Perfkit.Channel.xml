        @channel: A path to a channel.
        @killpid: True if the inferior process should be killed.

            Stops the PkdChannels profiling.  Attached data sources are

        PkdChannel::Pause()
        @channel: A path to a channel.

            Pauses a PkdChannels profiling.  Attached data sources are
            notified to stop producing samples.  If the source does not
            support pausing the samples will be dropped.

        Returns: True on success.

        @channel: A path to a channel.

            Unpauses a PkdChannels profiling.  Attached data sources
            are notified to wake up and continue producing samples.
            If any source manifests have changed during the time the
            channel was paused, they will be delivered to the
            subscribed clients.

        Returns: True on success.
