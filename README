  I.    Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfkit is a performance recording toolkit for developers and system
administrators.  It can be used for both profiling systems software and
applications as well as monitoring servers and remote devices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 II.    Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfkit is packaged in the standard format for most GNU/Linux-based software.
Use the standard `./configure', `make', `make install' to build and install
Perfkit.

Perfkit contains a runtime daemon that manages profiling and systems
monitoring.  It can be run using `perfkit-daemon'.

In the near future, a GUI will be provided to manage Perfkit recording
sessions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfkit is actively looking for contributors to help improve the codebase
and add collection data sources.

You can find more information on the architecture of Perfkit and a layout
of the codebase in HACKING which can be found in the same directory as this
file.

Perfkit was brought to you by Christian Hergert and Shapor Naghibzadeh.
